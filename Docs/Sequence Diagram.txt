== Unlocking Locker ==
note across
Alice and Bob want to unlock locker to 
access douments inside it
end note
ali -> loc : Alice enters her share
bob -> loc : Bob enters his share
loc -> sss : verifying shares entered
sss -> loc : shares verified
note over loc
Shares are verified meaning secret key 
calculated from the shares is correct. 
Hence locker is unlocked by two users 
instead of all four.
